Algorithm: Dot Product

Description:
This algorithm calculates the dot product of two vectors and determines whether they are orthogonal.

Procedure dot_product(v1, v2):
    ps = 0
    for i from 0 to length(v1) - 1 do:
        ps = ps + (v1[i] * v2[i])
    return ps

Procedure check_orthogonal(vectors):
    For each pair of vectors v1 and v2 in vectors do:
        dot_prod = dot_product(v1, v2)
        If dot_prod == 0 then:
            Print "The vectors v1 and v2 are orthogonal."
        Else:
            Print "The vectors v1 and v2 are not orthogonal."

Main Algorithm:
Read the value of n (the number of vector pairs)
Initialize an empty list called vectors

For i from 1 to n do:
    Read the values of vector v1
    Read the values of vector v2
    Add the pair (v1, v2) to the list vectors

Call the procedure check_orthogonal(vectors)
