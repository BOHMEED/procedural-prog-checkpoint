Algorithm: Insertion Sort

Procedure insertion_sort(arr):
    n = length(arr)
    for i from 1 to n-1 do:
        key = arr[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key do:
            arr[j+1] = arr[j]
            j = j - 1
        arr[j+1] = key

Main Algorithm:
Read the value of n (the size of the array)
Read the elements of the array into the variable arr

Call the procedure insertion_sort(arr)

Print the sorted array arr
